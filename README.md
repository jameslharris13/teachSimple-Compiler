# teachSimple-Compiler
Final year project / dissertation.

This project is to write a programming language to simplify the teaching of the principles of programming. The language has be tailored for children aged 14-16 who are currently studying Information technology/Computer science at secondary school.

The aim of the project was to simplify the teaching and learning of the different data types, iteration in programming, conditions and data structures.Having enjoyed the language design included in my FoPL module last year Iâ€™ve been thinking about the way programming is taught to beginners. In the summer, I went on placement to a secondary school and had the pleasure of teaching students computational problem solving techniques.

Taking inspiration from a handful of programming languages I have used basic syntax rules and clear abbreviations to remove the technical difficulty away from teaching people coding principles. To validate the effectiveness of my language I have invited 5 students from my target audience and asked them to experiment by writing basic programs. I will then use a simple questionnaire to gain feedback.

This project uses ANTLR to compile programs that have been written in teachSimple and transpiles them into Python, JavaScript and C++. The reason I selected these languages is because they are widely used in the KS3/KS4 new computing curriculum.
